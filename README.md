# Github Basics

### Cloning
- Use SSH to clone this repo to your local computer. 

### Working With Collaborators
- Checkout from master to a feature branch called "Chris" and make an edit to the EDITME.md file locally. 
- Commit your changes
- Push your changes to the remote branch "Chris"
- Make a pull request in Github to merge changes from the remote "Chris" branch into "master." 
- There is a branch called "Ariel" on remote. From the local Chris branch, fetch the "Ariel" branch and fix the merge conflicts. 
- Again, push your changes to the remote branch "Chris" and submit a pull request on Github to merge with master.
- Checkout to your local master branch. It should be 1 commit behind remote origin master. Use git to get your local master branch up to date.

### Rollback to Previous Commit
- From your up-to-date local master, checkout to a new branch called "rollback."
- Make 2 commits. 
- Rollback to the last commit.
- Push up your changes to remote "rollback" branch then once again submit a pull request to merge with master.

### Forking
- Fork master branch to your own repo.
- Edit the README.md file of your repo on the master branch directly on Github (not locally) and commit the changes. Compare this repo to your repo. Are they the same?
- Submit a pull request from your repo's master branch to my repo's master branch.
